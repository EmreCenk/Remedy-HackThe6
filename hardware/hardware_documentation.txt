Hello this is where the hardware documentation will be located

Arduino_1 Code Function:

Arduino 1 is the arduino driving the LCD display.
The code is opening a serial communication port at baudrate 9600, then looking for data being sent from the
raspberry pi. If the arduino receives the byte 'g', which stands for "good", it will display the dispense 
messages on the LCD. If it receives 'n', it will tell you no medication.
