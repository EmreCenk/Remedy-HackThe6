## Try it Our For Yourself

Since this project also has a hardware component, there is no way to fully try out the dispenser part. However, what you can do is try out our desktop application, and run the code that the hardware would run. 

### Testing the App:
Either clone this repo, or download it. Make sure you have all the requirements found in requirements.txt. After that, run the file main.py 

### Testing the AI Running on the Hardware:
run raspberrypitest.py
