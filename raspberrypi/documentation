The pi would send strings of either 'd' or 'gxy', where x is 0-4 (representing the medication type) and y is the amount. Everything else regarding the strings will be done in the
arduino. (The arduino take the "gxy" and then breaks it down)

so when you send the letter d, make the voice thing say "Face detected, please wait"
When it sends the "gxy" sequence, make the voice say "Dispensing, please wait"


That's really it for the arduino to pi communication. Just make sure that you replace the input in serial_comm.py and link it to facial recognition.
